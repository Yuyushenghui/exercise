    Translation by Ver.Thich Nhat Hanh<br><br><br>

    Avalokiteshvara<br>
    while practicing deeply with<br>
    the Insight that Brings Us to the Other Shore,<br>
    suddenly discovered that<br>
    all of the five Skandhas are equally empty,<br>
    and with this realisation
    he overcame all Ill-being.<br><br>
    
    “Listen Sariputra,<br>
    this Body itself is Emptiness<br>
    and Emptiness itself is this Body.<br>
    This Body is not other than Emptiness<br>
    and Emptiness is not other than this Body.<br>
    The same is true of Feelings,<br>
    Perceptions, Mental Formations,<br>
    and Consciousness.<br><br>
    
    “Listen Sariputra,<br>
    all phenomena bear the mark of Emptiness;<br>
    their true nature is the nature of<br>
    no Birth no Death,<br>
    no Being no Non-being,<br>
    no Defilement no Purity,<br>
    no Increasing no Decreasing.<br><br>
    
    “That is why in Emptiness,<br>
    Body, Feelings, Perceptions,<br>
    Mental Formations and Consciousness<br>
    are not separate self entities.<br><br>
    
    The Eighteen Realms of Phenomena<br>
    which are the six Sense Organs,<br>
    the six Sense Objects,<br>
    and the six Consciousnesses<br>
    are also not separate self entities.<br><br>
    
    The Twelve Links of Interdependent Arising
    and their Extinction<br>
    are also not separate self entities.<br>
    Ill-being, the Causes of Ill-being,<br>
    the End of Ill-being, the Path,<br>
    insight and attainment,<br>
    are also not separate self entities.<br><br>
    
    Whoever can see this<br>
    no longer needs anything to attain.<br><br>
    
    Bodhisattvas who practice<br>
    the Insight that Brings Us to the Other Shore<br>
    see no more obstacles in their mind,<br>
    and because there<br>
    are no more obstacles in their mind,<br>
    they can overcome all fear,<br>
    destroy all wrong perceptions<br>
    and realize Perfect Nirvana.<br><br>
    
    “All Buddhas in the past, present and future<br>
    by practicing<br>
    the Insight that Brings Us to the Other Shore<br>
    are all capable of attaining<br>
    Authentic and Perfect Enlightenment.<br><br>
    
    “Therefore Sariputra,<br>
    it should be known that<br>
    the Insight that Brings Us to the Other Shore<br>
    is a Great Mantra,<br>
    the most illuminating mantra,<br>
    the highest mantra,<br>
    a mantra beyond compare,<br>
    the True Wisdom that has the power<br>
    to put an end to all kinds of suffering.<br>
    Therefore let us proclaim<br>
    a mantra to praise<br>
    the Insight that Brings Us to the Other Shore.<br><br>
    
    Gate, Gate, Paragate, Parasamgate, Bodhi Svaha!
    Gate, Gate, Paragate, Parasamgate, Bodhi Svaha!
    Gate, Gate, Paragate, Parasamgate, Bodhi Svaha!”</p>
